Kubernetes is a container orchestrator.

Orchestration is a process where containers are deployed managed, scaled, load balanced in a group.

There are similar tools to kubernetes like docker swarm and mesos.

Orchestration will protect the app from harware failures as there are many instances of the app.

User traffic can be managed by load balancing.
